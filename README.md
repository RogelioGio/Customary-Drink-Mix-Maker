2nd Year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Thesis Project in Information Management <br>
<b> Mix-it til you make it: Customary Drink-Mix Maker Software </b><br>
<br>
  Our project software will be an interactive system that should provide customers 
with a selection of ingredients and drink options that are selected by them based on 
their preferences, changing the bar experience.<br>
<br>
From this our software will be run on a kiosk system with a user-friendly interface 
as the customer may mix and match each ingredient of the drink they want to 
concoct; from their preferred liquor type, additional ingredients, etc. In this system, 
we aim to enhance customer satisfaction, drive sales, and foster loyalty by 
providing customers with personalized and enjoyable drinks that are made from 
their own wanted tastes
